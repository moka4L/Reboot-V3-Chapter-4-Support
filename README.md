To use go to your prefered build location. Locate this specific folder: 

YourBuild\FortniteGame\Binaries\Win64

In that folder you put this file and simply open it, follow instructions inside the batch file.
Technically this dosent use Reboot but if you open a headless gameserver with Reboot and you are using a backend like Reload you are all good!        (You will need caldera service in which I don't have the arg for so you also have to find that...)

BTW the gameserver you currently use for everything probably will not work so you will have to make one :/


UPDATE: If EAC is opening you have most likely done something wrong, however if you are completly sure everything is correct then try editing the batch file and replacing "FortniteLauncher.exe" with "FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.exe"
