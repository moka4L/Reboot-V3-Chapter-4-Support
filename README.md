To use go to your prefered build location. Locate this specific folder: 

YourBuild\FortniteGame\Binaries\Win64

In that folder you put this file and simply open it, follow instructions inside the batch file.
Technically this dosent use Reboot but if you open a headless gameserver with Reboot and you are using a backend like Reload you are all good!
